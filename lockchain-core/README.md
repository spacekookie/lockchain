# lockchain-core

Library of common types used in the `lockchain` crate ecosystem. It exposes traits and serde-compatible generic types that are meant to be embedded into various applications. Also provides stubbed functions with `unimplemented!()` macros to allow rapid prototyping or selective feature implementations.

The documentation isn't complete, if you have questions how to use it don't hesitate to open an issue. And docs PR's always welcome ðŸ’š.

## How to use

The core types provided by this crate are

- `Vault<T>`
- `Record<T>`
- `Body`

The last one is a trait that provides a few shared functions for backend implementations. Some might want to only keep encrypted data around while others could selectively query different fields. Some have more advanced versioning, some don't, etc. Additionally we have more types to round out a vault (`Payload`, `Header`, etc).

A simple implementation of a body type could look like this.

```rust
extern crate lockchain_core as lockchain;
use lockchain::traits::{Body, Encryption};

#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize)]
struct EncryptedBody {
    // ... your fields here ...
}

impl Body for EncryptedBody {

    // ... function implementations ...
}

impl Encryption for EncryptedBody {
    // ... implement the functions ...
}
```
